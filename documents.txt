Redundancy refers to repeated instances of the same data. A database system provides redundancy control whereas in a file system, same data may be stored multiple times. For example, if a student is studying two different educational programs in the same college, say ,Engineering and History, then his information such as the phone number and address may be stored multiple times, once in Engineering dept and the other in History dept. Therefore, it increases time taken to access and store data. This may also lead to inconsistent data states in both places. A DBMS uses data normalization to avoid redundancy and duplicates.
